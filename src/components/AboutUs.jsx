        <p>
          This app was created by Santiago Mena Saravia, a junior programmer and bachelor of enviromental managment, as an open source web app to upload any bird species found in the district of San Isidro. The idea is to keep track to all bird species seen in san isidro and if posible take pictures of of them.
          The main idea is to have fun by capture nice image from birds and share the information.
